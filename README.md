### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes! There was nothing in this project that I felt unprepared to complete. Everything from passing in props to useEffect & useState was helpful.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I would completed the stretch features like adding a "favorites" and "watched" list. I also would've made the header have better effects that just sticking at the top.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went well, I just wasn't finished by the time we had to present. Something cool that some of my peers did was embed the video trailer onto the modal. That is also something I would try to do if I had more time.
